You are acting as a technical decision referee.
Compare AWS EC2 and AWS Lambda for backend application workloads.

Evaluate them under the following constraints:
- Cost sensitivity (low vs high)
- Scalability requirements (predictable vs bursty)
- Operational overhead (infrastructure management effort)
- Latency considerations
- Typical use cases

Provide the output in this structure:
1. EC2 – Pros
2. EC2 – Cons
3. Lambda – Pros
4. Lambda – Cons
5. Key Trade-offs
6. Recommendation logic depending on constraints

Focus on helping a user choose, not declaring a single winner.
